# Password-Gen

A Python tool that generates strong, memorable passwords tailored for websites, games, and online accounts.

This tool asks for a keyword or a game/site name (e.g., CS:GO, Steam), the desired length, and which special characters you want to include. It then generates 3 secure and human-friendly passwords. The security level of these passwords is above average.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

Itâ€™s super simple to operate. After downloading the file, just run the main script. No extra installation required.

> **Note:** For higher security, choose longer passwords with special characters. However, keep in mind this may reduce how easy they are to memorize. Enjoy!
